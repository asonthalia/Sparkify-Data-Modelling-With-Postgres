# ü´Ä Data Modelling in Postgres


This project is part of the Udacity Nanodegree¬Æ on Data Engineering. 

It aims to demonstrate database creation from a JSON store by creating appropriate database structures and populating correct data post ETL.

## Usage

Start by creating the database using,
```bash
python create_tables.py
```
Start the ETL process using,
```bash
python etl.py
```

The data will then be loaded to the tables created and can be tested using the ```test.ipynb``` notebook present in the repository.

Created using [Creatly](https://app.creately.com). Sorry for the attribute stacking in the ```SONGPLAYS``` table, creately only allows for 60 elements in their free version!

```ARTIST_ID``` is a duplicate column in ```SONGS``` and ```ARTISTS```; this makes a more read oriented structure that is always prefered in analytics. Since the objective is to optimise analytical workflow, this structure supports our goal.

All tables have been ensured to have a ```PRIMARY KEY```.
Column datatypes and sizes have been marked as per observed business data.
```LATITUDE``` and ```LONGITUDE``` have been capped till 5 digits accuracy after the decimal point to ensure ```~cm accuracy```. ([Source](https://rapidlasso.com/2019/05/06/how-many-decimal-digits-for-storing-longitude-latitude/))
