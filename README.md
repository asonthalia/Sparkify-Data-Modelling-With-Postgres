# ü´Ä Data Modelling in Postgres


This project is part of the Udacity Nanodegree¬Æ on Data Engineering. 

It aims to demonstrate database creation from a JSON store by creating appropriate database structures and populating correct data post ETL.

## Usage

Start by creating the database using,
```bash
python create_tables.py
```
Start the ETL process using,
```bash
python etl.py
```

The data will then be loaded to the tables created and can be tested using the ```test.ipynb``` notebook present in the repository.
